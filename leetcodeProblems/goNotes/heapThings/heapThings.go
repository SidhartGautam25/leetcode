// A heap is a binary tree-based data structure used primarily for priority queues.
// It comes in two main types:

// Min-Heap: The root node has the smallest value.
// Max-Heap: The root node has the largest value.

// Go provides a heap interface in the container/heap package, but you need to implement
//
//	the heap yourself by satisfying that interface.
package heapthings

// defining heap types
// This means IntHeap is a custom type based on []int (a slice of integers).
// So we can now attach methods to IntHeap, just like you attach methods to a struct.

// Now we are attaching method to IntHeap type

// This is part of Go's heap.Interface, which expects you to implement Push(x any) and
//  Pop() any.

// This is a method with a pointer receiver. That means h is not a value copy of the heap
//  â€” it's a reference to the actual heap slice.

// So if you change *h, you're modifying the original heap, not just a copy of it.

// Why Do We Reassign to *h?
// Because slices in Go are not always modified in-place.
// append() might return a new slice, especially if it grows
//
//	beyond its current capacity.
