// The Activity Selection Problem is a classic greedy algorithm problem where the goal
// is to select the maximum number of non-overlapping activities from a set of 
// activities, each with a start time and an end time.

// The greedy approach works by always picking the activity that finishes earliest.
//  The reasoning is that by picking activities that finish the earliest, we leave as
//  much room as possible for subsequent activities to fit in.
