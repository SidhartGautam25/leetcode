// solution 1
// Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm 
// here we first select the first element as our majority element
// then every time we get that element we increase the cnt by 1
// and when we get a element other than that we decrease the cnt by 1
// now when we have cnt equal to 0,then that means that at that time,
// our ele is not the one which is in majority,so we change the ele by the 
// other element and repeat the same thing
// lastly,after the interation is over,and if cnt is greater than 0
// then our ele can be our majority elemenet,but since 
// it is given that there is a majority element,so it will be our answer
